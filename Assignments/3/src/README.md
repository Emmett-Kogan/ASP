# Assignment 3
## Contributor(s)
1. Emmett Kogan

## Notes
1. The max length of a line of input isn't actually specified, for now I have a buffer 128 bytes long
2. The depth of the FIFOs isn't specified (and it won't be), for now I just have them 5 entries deep

## Build Instructions
1. Do `make` as the default rule `transfer` (`clean` deletes all produced files if you want to clean up)
2. <add instructions regarding the test script>
